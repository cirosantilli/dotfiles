used to backup/publish certain files from home dir

there are two methods intended:

- duplicity : cant select individual files
- vim : would add (master) to every command line under my home!

then ``home-sym-here`` to symlink files under ``file-list`` newline separated list to ``./files``

then ``here-sym-home`` to symlink files under ``./files`` back to home
